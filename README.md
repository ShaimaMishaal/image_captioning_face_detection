## ü§ñ Face Detection & Image Captioning :

A simple app to upload or capture an image, detect faces with bounding boxes, and generate a caption.

## ‚ú® Features :
1. Upload or capture image.
2. Detect faces and draw bounding boxes.
3. Generate image captions using a pre-trained model.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Models Used :
1. For Face Detection ( face_recognition ) :
- This model finds faces in a picture.
- It checks the image and looks for face features.
- It gives the position of each face so we can draw a box around it.


2. For Image Captioning ( Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-base ) : 
- This model looks at the image and writes a short description of what it sees.
- It understands the full picture, not only objects.
- It gives one sentence that explains what‚Äôs in the image.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Setup and Run :
1. Clone the repository :
git clone https://github.com/ShaimaMishaal/face_detection.git
cd your-repo-name

2. Create virtual environment : 
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate (Windows)
source venv/bin/activate (Linux / macOS)


3. Install dependencies :
pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run the Streamlit app :
streamlit run app.py

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes :
1. Installing face_recognition might require additional system packages like CMake and dlib.
2. Caption generation speed depends on your device performance and internet connection.
